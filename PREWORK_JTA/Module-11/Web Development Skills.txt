I am looking to take my development skills to the next level.  I want to be a production level coder able to work in any environment.  I want to develop an application from the ground up.  I would like to development my own applications.  I would like to build lasting business and personal relationships with my peers.

I am most excited about learning React and databases.  I love the interaction between the front end web side that we build and the population of user data that they request.  I am also excited about creating custom webpages.  I enjoy seeing what comes from a well developed website.

I want this class to help propel my career as a developer to the next level.  I am hoping to move up as my skill set grows.  I am looking to become a more seasoned architect.  I am also, excited to learn CI/CD process more in depth.  We use the Agile framework , but i am looking forward to getting a better understanding of the continuous development.  being able to push production code, test and make updates to applications will be a major bump to my knowledge base.  This class will be the push i need to move my career forward.

My career will take a turn from what i have been doing, but im looking forward to making my fresh start.  I will be working with network automation apps and developing custom ui to solve customer issues.  software defined skills will aid me in staying relevant in today's market.  I am hoping to add containerizing apps to my resume as well.  As long as i work hard, my career should blossom.  I am looking to learn from our instructor about what are good skills to pick up in this new field.  what i should focus on during and after the class.
